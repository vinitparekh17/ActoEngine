Docker Setup for ActoEngine

This plan will add Docker support for the ActoEngine full-stack application with separate containers for Backend, Frontend, and SQL Server.

Files to Create
1. Backend/Dockerfile
Multi-stage build for .NET 9.0 Web API
Stage 1: Build using mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0
Stage 2: Runtime using mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0
Copy project files, restore dependencies, build, and publish
Expose port 8080 (configurable via ASPNETCORE_URLS)
Set working directory and entry point
2. Backend/.dockerignore
Ignore build artifacts (bin/, obj/)
Ignore IDE files (.vs/, .vscode/)
Ignore local configuration files
3. Frontend/Dockerfile
Multi-stage build for React + Vite application
Stage 1: Build using node:20-alpine
Stage 2: Serve using nginx:alpine for production
Install dependencies, build production assets, and configure nginx
Expose port 80
4. Frontend/.dockerignore
Ignore node_modules/, dist/, build artifacts
Ignore IDE and environment files
5. docker-compose.yml (root directory)
Define three services:
sqlserver: SQL Server 2022 container with named volume for data persistence
backend: Build from Backend/Dockerfile, depends on sqlserver
frontend: Build from Frontend/Dockerfile, depends on backend
Configure environment variables for database connection
Set up networks and volume mappings
Configure health checks
6. .env.example (root directory)
Document required environment variables:
DB_SERVER, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
DB_TRUST_CERT (for development)
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT
ASPNETCORE_URLS
Implementation Details
Backend Dockerfile
Uses .NET 9.0 SDK for building
Copies csproj first for better layer caching
Embeds SQL migrations (already in .csproj)
Runs migrations and seeding on startup (handled by Program.cs)
Listens on port 8080 by default
Frontend Dockerfile
Uses Node.js 20 Alpine for smaller image
Builds production assets with npm run build
Serves with nginx with proper routing for SPA
Includes nginx configuration for React Router
Docker Compose Configuration
SQL Server: Uses mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
Sets ACCEPT_EULA=Y and generates strong SA password
Backend: Waits for SQL Server to be healthy before starting
Frontend: Waits for backend to be ready
Ports exposed:
Frontend: 5173 (matches Vite dev server port)
Backend: 5093 (HTTP), 7150 (HTTPS)
SQL Server: 1433
Environment Variables
Backend requires:

DB_SERVER=sqlserver (service name in docker-compose)
DB_PORT=1433
DB_NAME=ActoEngine
DB_USER=sa
DB_PASSWORD (from docker-compose secrets or environment)
DB_TRUST_CERT=true (for containerized SQL Server)
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
Usage
After implementation, users can:

Create .env file from .env.example with appropriate values
Run docker-compose up --build to build and start all services
Access Frontend at http://localhost:5173
Access Backend API at http://localhost:5093 or https://localhost:7150
Update readme to instruct users about project, how to run etc... most likely how any oss project do
